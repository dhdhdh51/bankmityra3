/**
 * Minimal PDF 1.4 generator: no FPDF, no Composer.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow - what the report exports and the visit report
 * printout need:
 *   - A4 portrait or landscape
 *   - Helvetica core fonts for Latin text (no embedding needed, so files stay
 *     small), plus an embedded Devanagari subset for Hindi
 *   - a branded header band, page numbers, repeated table headers
 *   - automatic column fitting, text truncation and page breaks
 *   - key/value detail blocks
 *
 * TEXT AND FONTS
 *
 * Latin text is drawn with the two standard Type1 fonts (Helvetica /
 * Helvetica-Bold) under WinAnsi (cp1252) encoding, same as before - no glyph
 * outlines to carry, and every viewer already has them.
 *
 * Hindi text is drawn with an embedded, subsetted Devanagari font (Noto Sans
 * Devanagari Regular/Bold, SIL OFL 1.1 - see admin/app/Resources/fonts) as a
 * Type0/CIDFontType2 font with an Identity-H CMap, because WinAnsi has no
 * Devanagari code points to encode and the 14 standard PDF fonts do not carry
 * Devanagari glyphs at all. Only the run of Devanagari characters in a string
 * switches font; Latin words mixed into the same value (an account number, a
 * BC code) still draw with Helvetica, which is both correct and the reason a
 * single line can carry both scripts without either one being replaced with
 * "?".
 *
 * A rupee sign has no glyph in either font here, so it is still written as
 * "Rs." rather than emitted as a character that would print as a box.
 *
 * See App\Core\Fonts\Devanagari for what shaping this implementation does and
 * does not do - it draws Devanagari as separate glyphs rather than the
 * ligated conjuncts a full OpenType shaping engine would produce, which is
 * legible but not what a properly shaped renderer looks like.
