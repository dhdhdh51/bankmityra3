/**
 * The app's language, as the agent chooses it.
 *
 * WHY A PER-APP LOCALE AND NOT A CONFIGURATION OVERRIDE
 *
 * The obvious implementation is to wrap every base context, swap the `Locale` in a
 * `Configuration` and recreate the activity. It is also the one that crashes: the wrapped
 * context and the one Android hands to a dialog, a `WebView` or a notification builder
 * disagree, the resource cache holds strings from the previous locale, and anything that
 * outlives the activity - a foreground service, an alarm receiver, a notification channel
 * name - reads whichever locale it happened to be created under.
 *
 * `AppCompatDelegate.setApplicationLocales()` is the platform's own answer (framework on
 * API 33+, backported below it). Android performs the switch, recreates what needs
 * recreating, and everything that asks for a string afterwards - including code with no
 * `Activity` anywhere near it - gets the chosen language.
 *
 * WHY THE CHOICE IS ALSO STORED HERE
 *
 * appcompat can persist it for us, but only with `autoStoreLocales` metadata and a
 * synchronous read on the main thread at startup. We already have a preferences file, so
 * the tag is written there and reapplied in `LrmsApp.onCreate()`. That also means the
 * stored value is inspectable and testable without an Android framework at all, which is
 * what the unit tests exercise.
 *
 * The class is deliberately free of Android context: [fromTag], [tagFor] and [labelFor]
 * are pure, so the mapping between what is stored, what is applied and what the agent
 * sees is covered by ordinary JVM tests rather than by hoping.
