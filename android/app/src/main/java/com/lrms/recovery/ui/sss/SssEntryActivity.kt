/**
 * The agent's own SSS enrolment figures for the day.
 *
 * This screen exists because of an asymmetry that had become indefensible: the
 * nightly warning check measures APY, PMJJBY, PMSBY and PMJDY against each agent's
 * monthly target and escalates a sustained shortfall to the supervisor, then the
 * service provider, then the regional office - while the only place those four
 * numbers could be entered was the admin panel, which an agent cannot open. So an
 * agent could receive a written warning for failing to report figures the software
 * gave them no way to report.
 *
 * Two deliberate choices in the layout:
 *
 *   VISITS ARE SHOWN, NOT ASKED FOR. Visits, contacts and PTP are counted from the
 *   reports already filed and are read-only here. There is no field anywhere in this
 *   app for typing a visit count - a self-reported number that a supervisor's report
 *   also computes independently is two answers waiting to disagree.
 *
 *   TODAY AND YESTERDAY ONLY. Enforced by the server, reflected here by disabling the
 *   form. Backdating a month of enrolments the evening before an assessment is
 *   exactly the pressure a scored metric creates.
