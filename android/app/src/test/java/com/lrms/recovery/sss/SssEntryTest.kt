/**
 * Guards the asymmetry between figures an agent types and figures the system counts.
 *
 * The four scheme counts are typed. Visits, contacts and PTP are counted from filed
 * reports. If a visit-count field ever appears in this app, there are immediately two
 * answers to "how many visits did this agent make today" - the typed one and the one
 * the supervisor's report computes - and the agent is scored on one while defending
 * the other.
