/**
 * Guards the one property of photo geo-stamping that matters.
 *
 * A camera capture may carry coordinates. A gallery pick may not. If that ever
 * inverts - or if the gallery path simply forgets to clear a previous capture's
 * stamp - the app starts attaching a doorstep position to an image chosen from
 * somebody's photo roll, and the report asserts a place the agent may never have
 * stood. That is manufactured evidence in a recovery file, and it would be
 * invisible: the photo looks the same either way.
