/**
 * The language choice, as stored and read back.
 *
 * Worth testing on the JVM rather than only on a device, because the failure modes are all
 * in the mapping and none of them are visible: a tag that does not round-trip leaves an
 * agent's choice silently ignored on the next launch, and an unrecognised tag that throws
 * would crash the app in `Application.onCreate()` - before any screen exists to show an
 * error, which on a phone is indistinguishable from the app being broken.
