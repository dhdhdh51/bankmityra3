/**
 * Checks every Subresource Integrity hash in the layouts against the real file
 * on the CDN.
 *
 * This exists because a wrong hash is a silent, total failure with no error
 * message anywhere near the cause. A live deployment shipped a Bootstrap CSS
 * hash whose first fourteen characters were correct and whose remainder was
 * from something else. The browser therefore refused to apply the stylesheet at
 * all, and the visible symptom was "the profile menu never closes" - because
 * `.dropdown-menu { display: none }` is Bootstrap's, and it was never applied.
 *
 * Nothing server-side can catch that: the HTML is correct, the tag is correct,
 * the panel's own 130 smoke checks pass. Only comparing the hash to the bytes
 * the browser will actually fetch catches it.
 *
 *   php tools/verify-cdn-integrity.php
 *
 * Needs outbound HTTPS. Exits 0 when every hash matches, 1 otherwise, and 2 when
 * the network is unavailable - a missing network is not a broken hash.
