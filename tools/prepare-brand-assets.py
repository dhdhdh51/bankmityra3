"""
Derives the shipped brand assets from the one master artwork.

The master is docs/brand/d2-recovery-lockup.jpg - the logo as supplied. Keeping it
in the repo and generating everything from it means the app and the panel can
never drift apart, and a new master only has to be dropped in once.

Two assets come out of it:

  lockup  the full square lockup - mark, wordmark, tagline and the five badges.
          Used large: the app's launch screen and both login pages. Never use it
          small; the tagline and badge captions stop being legible.

  mark    the monogram alone, cropped out of the master. Used small: the panel
          header and the mobile login header, where the full lockup would be an
          unreadable smudge.

    python3 tools/prepare-brand-assets.py

WebP because it is a photographic image with a gradient: the same quality as JPEG
at roughly half the bytes, and supported by every browser and by Android since
API 14 - well below this project's minSdk 24.
